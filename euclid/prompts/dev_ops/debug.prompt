Ok, we need to debug this issue so we can execute `{{ command }}` successfully. I want you to debug this issue by yourself and I will give you 2 functions that you can use - `run_command` and `implement_code_changes`.

`run_command` function will run a command on the machine and will return the CLI output to you so you can see what to do next.

`implement_code_changes` function will change the code where you just need to thoroughly describe what needs to be implmemented, I will implement the requested changes and let you know.

After this, you need to deside what to do next. You can rerun the command `{{ command }}` to check if the problem is fixed or run another command with `run_command` or change more code with `implement_code_changes`.
