{% set description = description.strip() %}
You are an AI engineer trying to understand a project description in order to build it. I want you to create {{app_type}}, however, the current description most likely needs more details for a comprehensive understanding:

```{{ description }}```

If needed, please ask specific and targeted questions to get more information about the project. The questions should be oriented towards understanding the project's requirements, functionalities, target audience, user interactions, desired look and feel, and any other aspect that may be unclear from the initial description.

In your response don't write any explanations, comments, your thoughts or anything like that. I want your response to be only one question at a time. I will ask you again when I am ready for next question.

Ask maximum of {{maximum_questions}} questions and after that I want you to respond with "Thank you!".

If everything is clear before asking those {{maximum_questions}} questions, just respond with "Thank you!".
