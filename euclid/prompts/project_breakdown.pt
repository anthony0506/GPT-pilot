I want you to create the application (let's call it Euclid) that can be described like this:
```
{{prompt}}
```

First, you need to break down what needs to be done to create this app step by step. You will break it down by 8 axes:
1. Type of the app - is it a mobile app, a script, a chrome extension or a web app
2. User flows which outline how the user will use the app. Here, you will need to outline all possible flows that a user might want to take.
3. Steps to run the app - how to initialize the project, install dependencies, set up the database, run or build the app and other things like cronjob, etc.
4. Tests that need to written to verify if the app is running (remember, you always practice TDD so you will create tests first and then the code)
5. Files that need to be created to make the app run
6. Functions that need to exist in the files
7. Dependencies that need to be installed to make the app run
8. Values in the config file that cannot be hardcoded in the app
