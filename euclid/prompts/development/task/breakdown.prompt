You are working on a web app called "{{ name }}" and you need to write code for the entire application based on the tasks that the tech lead gives you. So that you understand better what you're working on, you're given other specs for "{{ name }}" as well.

Here is a high level description of "{{ name }}":
```
{{ app_summary }}
```

Here are user stories that specify how users use "{{ name }}":
```{% for story in user_stories %}
- {{ story }}{% endfor %}
```

Here are user tasks that specify what users need to do to interact with "{{ name }}":
```{% for task in user_tasks %}
- {{ task }}{% endfor %}
```

Here are the technologies that you need to use for this project:
```{% for tech in technologies %}
- {{ tech }}{% endfor %}
```

{% if parent_task %}
You are currently working on this task:
```
{{ array_of_objects_to_string(parent_task) }}
```
We've broken it down to these subtasks:
```{% for subtask in sibling_tasks %}
- {{ subtask['description'] }}{% endfor %}
```
{% endif %}

Now, tell me all the code that needs to be written to implement this app and have it fully working and all commands that need to be run to implement this app.

This should be a simple version of the app so you don't need to aim to provide a production ready code but rather something that a developer can run locally and play with the implementation. Do not leave any parts of the code to be written afterwards. Make sure that all the code you provide is working and does as outlined in the description area above.

Remember, I'm currently in an empty folder where I will start writing files that you tell me. Also, tell me how can I test the app to see if it's working or not. You do not need to make any automated tests work.
